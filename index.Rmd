# Announcements

<br/><br/>

- For questions on grading or any other topic related to the class, let's make use of office hours.

- The recording of the lectures are posted on canvas 24 h after class

- The recording of recitations together with the slides are also posted on canvas

- We will catch up on grading this week!

---

# Outline

<br/><br/>

- What game theory is and how/why it is applied to biology

--

- Evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) and frequency dependent selection

--

- Examples

---

# Netlogo Model of Hawk-Dove Games

<br/><br/>

- Download NetLogo from [here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/6.2.0/). NetLogo does have an HTML format but this model is too outdated to be used on it


- Download the Hawk - Dove model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_OowptjexVBiWE0FBsq8pH82uI0dBjEd/view?usp=sharing)

# Game Theory

<br/><br/>

- Game Theory is the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation

--


- Forms the basis of many economic theories, war strategies, sociological theories, and even board games

--


- John Maynard Smith emphasized the potential for its use in behavioral ecology

---


# Evolutionary Game Theory


Evolutionary game theory focuses more on dynamics of strategy change. Influenced by the frequency of the competing strategies in the population

# Behavioral polymorphism

- Two or more morphs in a population or species

- Constant competition/cooperation between them

# Game theory features


- Individual players make decisions

--

- The players will behave rationally, and according to some criterion of self-interest

--

- The strategy of each individual will depend in part by the strategies of the other players

`r colorize("Hawks", "orange")`:

- Better than doves when many doves
- Worse than doves when many hawks

- There is an equilibrium hawk frequency, adding individuals of each strategy lowers fitness relative to the alternative strategy

- No best "pure" strategy, no `r colorize("Evolutionary Stable Strategy", "orange")`

- Fitness for strategies are **frequency dependant**
